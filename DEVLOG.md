## Session 1: M0 Bootstrap Setup

### Decisions Made
- **Workspace structure**: 20 crates per spec, plus apps and xtask
- **Dependencies pinned**: All in Cargo.lock, see list below
- **lf_engine**: winit + wgpu for windowing, basic render loop
- **Cross-platform**: all crates checked on macOS; cross-platform target set

### Dependencies (Workspace-level)
- winit 0.29 - windowing
- wgpu 24.0 - graphics (Vulkan/Metal/DX12)
- glam 0.30 - math
- tracing + tracing-subscriber - logging
- egui 0.29 + egui-winit + egui-wgpu - UI
- kira 0.9 - audio
- pollster - async runner

### Notes
- Working on macOS arm64 (Mac mini M1)
- Window builds successfully, event loop runs
- Still resolving wgpu/egui integration details for M0
- Next: M1 - First voxel rendering

### Pending
- Need to add src/lib.rs to all 20 crates
- Need to add goldens and test scaffolding
- CI pipeline not yet configured (GitHub Actions)
## Session: /init bookkeeping setup (2026-08-25)

### What was done
- Created `AGENTS.md` (workspace instruction file for future ZCode agents).
- Created `Makefile` at the repo root as the .mk info file: documents every
  common command as a target (`make help`), including `runtimes` (macOS
  .app/.dmg + Linux tarball + optional Windows exe) and `push`.
- Added the `github` remote pointing at
  https://github.com/International-Coders/poorcraft.git.

### How
- AGENTS.md covers: read-first docs (STATE/BACKLOG/CHANGELOG), ground rules
  (no docs-only commits, vistest pixel proofs), build/verify commands,
  MANDATORY job bookkeeping (keep Makefile current, log every action in
  DEVLOG.md with what/how/evidence, push to the GitHub remote after every
  commit), mandatory desktop runtimes per finished job, crate layout,
  layer rules, and known gotchas.
- Makefile verified with `make help` (all targets listed).

### Evidence
- `make help` output lists 12 targets.
- `git remote -v` shows `github -> International-Coders/poorcraft.git`.
