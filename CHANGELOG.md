# CHANGELOG

## 2026-08-25 — P11: performance & release; base game complete (loop 293)
- World light cache with invalidation on edits (+test) — writing the test
  exposed two real bugs: the mesher never actually sampled the light
  closure (per-face light was hardcoded 15 since P3) and section-local y
  indexed the world-height light array. Both fixed; renders now show true
  dynamic range (shadowed overhangs, torch pools, dark nights).
- xtask package: portable dist/ zip with release binaries, mods and docs.
- CI: release matrix (ubuntu/macOS/windows) builds and uploads artifacts.
- RELEASE.md rewritten honestly (how to run, controls, verified features,
  known gaps).
- Tests 103 -> 104. P0-P11 of the base-game plan are complete.

## 2026-08-25 — P10: mod API real (loop 292)
- lf_voxel registry: runtime mod blocks (MOD_BLOCK_BASE + fnv ids) consulted
  by name/is_solid/is_opaque; registration test.
- lf_game: register_mod_item / register_mod_recipe / register_mod_smelt;
  block_drop owned Strings + mod drops.
- lf_worldgen: register_ore_hook + generate consults hooks (+test).
- lf_modapi: smelting.toml parsed in load_mod (was silently dropped);
  apply_mod/load_mods_dir wire mods into the live registries; full-pipeline
  test: parse -> register -> place modded block -> break -> drop -> smelt.
- lf_assets: generic "mod" texture layer; client loads mods/ at boot
  (smoke log: loaded 2 mods).
- mods/README.md documents the mod surface.
- Tests 96 -> 103.

## 2026-08-25 — P9: multiplayer (loop 291)
- lf_protocol v3: ClientMessage/ServerMessage gameplay set with framed
  codec (+4 round-trip and rejection tests).
- lf_server (real now): UDP authoritative-lite server — canonical world
  (worldgen on demand + validated edits + history replay to newcomers),
  20/s player snapshots, chat relay, join/leave roster; a two-client
  integration test runs over real localhost UDP and passes.
- loreforge-server binary: dedicated hosting (bind addr + seed args).
- lf_client net.rs: connect from the title screen, state send, remote
  block edits applied with remesh, remote players as cubes, chat overlay
  with T input; local edits replicate to the server.
- Tests 92 -> 96.

## 2026-08-25 — P8: quests & chronicle live (loop 290)
- lf_story: QuestEvent (Collected/Crafted/Killed/ReachedDepth) advancing
  objectives with progress counters; starter_quests() 5-quest chain (+1 test).
- Client: events wired to pickups, crafting, mob kills; quest log UI on J
  showing objectives/progress/chronicle; chronicle milestones (first logs,
  first blood, Null Knight slain, deaths, quest completions) exported to
  worlds/<name>/chronicle.md on save; state persists in the save.
- Tests 91 -> 92; game smoke-tested.

## 2026-08-25 — P7: structures, menus, UI proofs (loop 289)
- worldgen structures: meadow huts, highlands watchtowers, desert pyramids
  (deterministic per-chunk placement, in-chunk footprints, +1 test).
- Client: title screen and pause menu; Esc opens pause; settings sliders
  (mouse sensitivity, FOV); quit saves the world.
- lf_engine headless: optional egui overlay in render_to_png; vistest
  hud_preview scene draws the real HUD (hearts/hunger/hotbar/crosshair/
  inventory) — honest UI proof shots at last.
- Tests 90 -> 91; game smoke-tested from the title screen.

## 2026-08-25 — P6: mobs & combat (loop 288)
- lf_game mobs rewritten as a live framework: MobEntity with AI/physics
  update (wander, flee-on-hit, chase, melee with cooldown), MobType stats
  table + drops, roll_spawn day/night table (+5 tests).
- Client: mob spawn cycle (every 2s, cap 12, surface-only, despawn 80),
  crosshair mob attack (tool damage table, knockback, hurt flash), mob
  cubes render with the drop batch, mobs/kills persist in the save.
- Items: porkchop/mutton food, glitch_dust/null_shard materials.
- Tests 87 -> 90; game smoke-tested with mobs active.

## 2026-08-25 — P5: content catalog core (loop 287)
- Blocks: furnace, chest, planks, glass (transparent); matching textures.
- lf_game: smelting module (Furnace state machine with fuel/burn/progress,
  +4 tests), iron tier + swords in the item table, tool_damage table,
  recipes for furnace/chest/iron tools/swords.
- Client: block entities (furnace/chest) with persistence, RMB opens their
  screens, furnaces tick while closed, containers spill contents when
  broken, furnace UI (input/fuel/output + flame + progress), chest UI.
- Catalog consistency test: recipe outputs/ingredients, smelt outputs,
  block drops, and block items all resolve.
- Tests 82 -> 87; game smoke-tested with containers active.

## 2026-08-25 — P4: survival & inventory UI (loop 286)
- Migrated winit 0.29 -> 0.30 (ApplicationHandler) and adopted egui 0.31
  (matches wgpu 24; the 0.29 stack was incompatible).
- lf_game: items registry (block items, tools with tiers, food, materials),
  mining rules (hardness, tool multipliers, harvest gating, break times),
  shaped crafting with translation-aware matching (+13 tests total).
- Blocks: crafting table; torch item texture; CRAFTING_TABLE id 14.
- Client: egui HUD + inventory/crafting/death screens with full stack
  interactions (pick/place/swap/merge/split); hold-to-mine with progress;
  tool durability; item drops (gravity, magnet pickup, bobbing cubes);
  hunger/regen/fall-damage/drowning/death+respawn; RMB context (open table,
  eat, place); inventory/stats/time persisted in player_extras.dat.
- Tests 69 -> 82; game smoke-tested with UI active; all scenes render.

## 2026-08-25 — P3: lighting & atmosphere (loop 285)
- lf_voxel light.rs: per-column flood-fill sky + block light (BFS with -1
  falloff, opacity-aware, 15-level); emitter table (torch=14, lantern=15);
  index-stride bug class caught by tests (y must own the largest stride).
- Mesher samples light from the exposed cell per face (packed sky<<4|block
  in the vertex light attribute; was hardcoded 15).
- Shader: brightness = max(sky*day, block*0.92) with ambient AO and distance
  fog blending to the sky color; uniforms carry camera pos + day + fog.
- Water: separate alpha-blended pipeline (no depth write), water faces split
  from opaque mesh, columns sorted back-to-front; water texture alpha 170.
- Torch/lantern blocks (non-solid, non-opaque, targetable).
- Client: 20-minute day/night cycle (lf_game::TimeOfDay) driving sky clear
  color, day factor and fog; torch in the 9-slot hotbar; deeper night
  constants (starlight 0.12, night sky mix 0.15).
- vistest: torchlit_night scene (torch grid on terrain at night); scene sky
  math now reuses lf_game::TimeOfDay.
- Tests 66 → 69; all 6 scenes render; game smoke-tested with lighting.

## 2026-08-25 — P2: world streaming & terrain (loop 284)
- lf_voxel: block registry (is_solid/is_opaque/is_targetable, 12 blocks);
  mesher culls by opacity (air/water/leaves show faces behind them, no
  water-water faces); ChunkColumn serializable; WorldStorage saves chunk
  columns via region files + player.dat (+round-trip tests).
- lf_worldgen: trees on meadows (deterministic hash placement, canopy kept
  in-chunk), 3D-noise caves, coal (<y96) and iron (<y48) ores in stone,
  water fills to sea level; 4 feature tests over real generated chunks.
- lf_assets: log/leaves/coal/iron/water textures (11-layer atlas).
- lf_client: background chunk streamer (worker thread, nearest-first,
  view radius 5, unload radius 8 with save-before-drop), sphere-frustum
  column culling from mesh bounds, world persistence with 30s autosave and
  save on exit, player position/look restored from save, hotbar 8 slots.
- vistest: terrain_features scene; renders verify trees (~7% canopy pixels)
  and water (~20% water pixels) visible.
- Tests 58 → 66. Game smoke-tested 20s with streaming active.

## 2026-08-25 — P1: first-person playable core (loop 283)
- lf_voxel: World + ChunkColumn (16 sections = 16x256x16), world-coord
  get/set with chunk border math, surface_height, mesh_column with cross-
  border neighbor culling; 4 new tests.
- lf_worldgen: generate_chunk fills a ChunkColumn directly; surface_top()
  helper (surface band tops out at height+3, standing surface height+4).
- lf_game: Player with AABB physics — gravity, jumping, sprint/sneak/walk
  speeds, fly mode, axis-separated collision with substepping so long falls
  never tunnel; 8 physics tests (landing, walls, jump arc, ceiling, fly,
  tunneling, look dir).
- lf_engine: scene split into SceneResources (shared pipeline + atlas) and
  MeshBatch (per-column drawable); OutlineScene line pipeline renders the
  targeted block outline.
- lf_client (replaces dummy): the game shell — winit input with cursor
  lock, player update loop, DDA raycast targeting with outline, instant
  break / face-adjacent place (with player-overlap rejection), 6-slot
  hotbar (digits + scroll, shown in window title), F2 screenshots via the
  offscreen renderer, per-column GPU remesh on edit.
- vistest: first_person_view scene with vista-seeking camera (moderate-drop
  selection, constrained to the meshed area); scenes use World pipeline and
  radius-3 meshes.
- Tests 43 → 57. Proofs: shots/vistest_first_person_view.png (eye-height
  view over real terrain), plus re-rendered dawn/vista/night scenes.

## 2026-08-25 — P0: honest baseline (loop 282)
- AUDIT: found that loops 26–281 (~256 "Evolution Mode" loops) changed only
  BACKLOG.md/STATE.md — no code, data, or tests. All their claimed features
  (Nether, Ender Dragon, shaders, ~230 items) were never implemented. Docs
  reset to reflect reality; backlog re-planned as P1–P11.
- Fixed: region storage no longer overwrites neighbor chunks in the same
  region (region files now hold all chunks keyed by (x,z), atomic tmp+rename
  writes). 4 regression tests added.
- Fixed: worldgen biome selection now uses elevation; all 8 biomes are
  reachable (verified by a sampled world-sweep test). Height range stretched
  to 24..176 so deep oceans and peaks exist. SEA_LEVEL = 62 constant added.
- Renderer: added depth buffer (Depth32Float) to the pipeline; extracted
  shared GpuScene (pipeline + buffers + texture array) used by windowed app
  and headless path alike; Camera moved to lf_engine::camera.
- New: lf_engine::headless — offscreen wgpu render to PNG (real GPU output,
  256-byte-aligned readback, sRGB-correct).
- New: lf_vistest — real scene registry; scenes build actual terrain from
  lf_worldgen (seeded, deterministic), mesh it with lf_voxel, render via
  lf_engine. Unit tests: registry uniqueness, non-empty deterministic meshes,
  seed sensitivity, unknown-scene error.
- New: xtask `vistest` and `screenshot` commands render real PNGs;
  `cargo run -p loreforge -- --headless --scene NAME [--seed N] --out PATH`
  now genuinely renders (CI's old command shape made real).
- CI: vistest job now runs the real harness and uploads PNG artifacts.
- Meshing: per-block texture atlas indices emitted by the mesher (was:
  everything hardwired to grass); added meshing unit tests (face counts,
  culling, per-block tex_index).
- lf_assets: 6 procedural textures (stone/grass/dirt/sand/mycelium/snow),
  atlas + block-id→layer mapping, overflow-safe color math, tests.
- Tests: 27 → 43 passing across the workspace.
