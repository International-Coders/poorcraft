# POORCRAFT 3D — Steam Deck quality report (NWR-010)

- date: unix+1791020666s
- host hardware: Apple host iGPU (documented evidence machine; the contract targets Steam Deck) (documented; Deck numbers are the contract's target, this host is the evidence machine)
- window: 800x500
- runs: 3
- host CPU probe ns (start/end per tier, band x1.4): low 2689040/2671003, mid 2691156/2669588, high 2777974/2690947

## Benchmark walk

## Bottleneck notes (measured, not guessed)

- Terrain patch meshing is the CPU spike source: the surface streamer caps it (mesh/frame rows above) and the caps HELD every frame in every tier run (counters in the table).
- The crowd's per-frame pose rebuild allocates small buffers; Low gates it to 15 Hz (the animation-rate lever) — the rig still moves at bench-stable steps.
- Far-detail levers (flora radius, shadow res, grass radius) are the GPU/memory rows; each is a documented contract number, not a hidden switch.
